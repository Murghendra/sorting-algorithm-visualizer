## Features
- Interactive visualization: Users can visualize sorting algorithms in action.
- Multiple sorting algorithms: The application supports various sorting algorithms, including bubble sort, insertion sort, selection sort, merge sort, quick sort, and more.
- Adjustable speed: Users can control the speed of the sorting animation to observe the process more closely.
- Array size customization: Users can adjust the size of the array to be sorted, allowing them to analyze the performance of the algorithms with different input sizes.
- Random array generation: The application provides a feature to generate random arrays for sorting.

## Usage
1. Open the `Sorting Visualizer` in your web browser.
2. Choose a sorting algorithm from the available options.
3. Adjust the speed and array size if desired.
4. Click the "Generate Array" button to create a new random array or manually enter your own array.
5. Click the "Sort" button to start the visualization.
6. Observe the sorting process as the bars move and rearrange themselves.
7. Once the sorting is complete, you can generate a new array and try different algorithms or configurations.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
